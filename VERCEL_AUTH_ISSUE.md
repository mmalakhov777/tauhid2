# Vercel Authentication Issue

## Problem
When deploying to Vercel, all API routes (including `/api/telegram/webhook` and `/api/external-chat`) are being redirected to Vercel SSO authentication, even though they are configured as public routes in the middleware.

## Symptoms
- API endpoints return HTML authentication page instead of JSON responses
- Telegram webhook fails because it can't authenticate
- External chat API is inaccessible

## Root Cause
This appears to be a Vercel team/organization-level setting that enforces SSO authentication on all routes, overriding the application-level middleware configuration.

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. ‚úÖ Middleware Configuration (Already Done)
```typescript
const publicRoutes = [
  '/api/telegram', // Allow Telegram webhook
  '/api/external-chat', // Allow external chat API
];
```

### 2. ‚úÖ vercel.json Headers (Already Done)
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/telegram/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Vercel-Skip-Auth",
          "value": "1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. üîÑ Potential Solutions to Try

#### Option A: Vercel Team Settings
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Team Settings ‚Üí Security
2. Look for "Deployment Protection" or "SSO Settings"
3. Add exceptions for API routes or disable for this project

#### Option B: Environment Variables
Add to Vercel environment variables:
```
VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1
VERCEL_SKIP_AUTH_ROUTES=/api/telegram,/api/external-chat
```

#### Option C: Different Deployment Method
- Deploy to a different Vercel team/account without SSO enforcement
- Use a different hosting provider (Railway, Render, etc.)

#### Option D: Subdomain Approach
- Deploy API routes to a separate subdomain
- Use `api.yourdomain.com` without authentication

## Current Workaround

**Using ngrok tunnel for development/testing:**
```bash
# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 3000

# Set webhook to tunnel URL
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/telegram/webhook node scripts/setup-telegram-webhook.js set
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check Vercel Team Settings**: Look for deployment protection settings
2. **Contact Vercel Support**: If this is a team-level enforcement
3. **Alternative Hosting**: Consider other platforms if Vercel restrictions can't be bypassed
4. **Separate API Deployment**: Deploy just the API routes to a different service

## Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Local development with ngrok: **Working**
- ‚ùå Vercel deployment: **Blocked by authentication**
- ‚úÖ Bot functionality: **Fully implemented and tested**
- ‚úÖ External chat API: **Fully implemented and tested**

The bot and API are fully functional - the only issue is the Vercel deployment authentication layer.
