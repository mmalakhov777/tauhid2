This file indicates that an Al-Hidaya book cover image should be placed at:
/public/images/al-hidaya.png

The image should be:
- A cover image of the classical Islamic jurisprudence book "Al-Hidaya" 
- Similar dimensions to other book covers in this directory (around 3-4MB, high resolution)
- PNG format
- Should show the book title and author information clearly

Until the actual image is added, the code will fallback to using the Fatawa Qazi Khan cover image.
